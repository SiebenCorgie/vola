# Changelog

For all Vola and RVSDG related crates.


## [0.2]

### Added

- [PR34](https://gitlab.com/tendsinmende/vola/-/merge_requests/34): Add _Common-Node-Elemination_ pass. This is similar to _Common-Subexpression-Elemination_ but works across regions
- [PR35](https://gitlab.com/tendsinmende/vola/-/merge_requests/35): Add _Constant-Node-Folding_ pass. This adds a `ConstantFoldable` trait. If implemented, nodes can chose to constant-fold them selfs, based on compile-time known inputs.
- Add Doc pointers to the generically implemented passes in the `utils` module.
- Add `ImmBool` (to Opt) and ConstantBool (To Spirv backend).

### Changed

- [PR36]https://gitlab.com/tendsinmende/vola/-/merge_requests/35): Refactor WkOp into several node types for easier partial implementations
- Implemented topological-order based on khan's algorithm instead of reversing the reverse-topological order, which was a false assumption.
### Fixed

- Fixes _most_ doc errors in the `rvsdg` crate.
- Fixed bug where unifiying a apply node via unify_simple would panic

## [0.1]

_We consider anything that happened before [PR34](https://gitlab.com/tendsinmende/vola/-/merge_requests/34) to be pre-alpha work_.
