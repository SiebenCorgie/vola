//! RVSDG building utilies. If your source is based on structured-control flow, the standart RVSDG builder should give
//! you everything needed to setup a a RVSDG representation.
//!
//! For non-SCF based source the paper outlines a construction strategy in 5.1, however this is not (yet) implemented.
//!
//!
//! In general the builder pattern usually represents some region that is currently worked on.
//! Those regions _usually_ mostly consist of [_Simple_ nodes](crate::nodes::Node). Whenever one of the more complex constructs is needed,
//! like a loop, if-then-else, function calls etc. the builder provides special methodes to build those.
//!
//! Nesting is represented by the closures used to build such special methodes.
