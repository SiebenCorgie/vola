//! # Vola-AST
//!
//! Vola's *A*bstract *S*yntax *T*ree.
//!
//!
//! As outlined in the design document, there are two types of AST. A CSG-AST, that represents the geometric operations, and a
//! algebraic AST, that defines those operations.
//!
//! The AST-Parsers job is to split both (somewhat like a preprocessor I guess?) into independent trees, that reference each other
//! _by name_.
