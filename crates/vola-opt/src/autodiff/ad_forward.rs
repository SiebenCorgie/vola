//! # Forward-Mode auto differentiation
//!
//! Implements the forward autodiff pass based on a diff-entry point node.
//!
//! ## Basic idea
//!
//! The idea of the forward pass is relatively straight forward. Similar to the specialization pass we walk
//! _through_ our expression graph. For any _dynamic_ node, so any node that uses _the_ wrt-argument, we split off
//! the walk through as f'(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x), where f'(g(x)) is one split, and g'(x) is the other split.
//!
//! In order to be able to do that we assume that the expression is already in _ad-canonicalized-form_. So is only made from
//! essential operations.
//!
//! In forward mode, control flow stays _in the same order_ so branches/gamma nodes work the same way (chose
//! one of the derivatives in a branch), and loops also work the same way, just for the derivative.
//!
//! In practice we copy over control-flow nodes into the derivative calculation part and replace a result r with the
//! derivative of r.
//!
//! ## Implementation details
//!
//! ### Highlevel
//!
//! We start from just a single `AutoDiff` node.
//! The first part is canonicalizing the subgraph referenced by the first argument into ad-able form.
//! That means mostly transforming/unfolding complex expressions into _elementary_ operations, as well as checking
//! That no _none-ad-able_ nodes are in the graph.
//!
//! NOTE: Right now we also inline all function calls, because that makes life easier atm. However, it would be nicer
//! to specialize a _derivative-of-that-λ_, that could be reused if needed.
//!
//! After that we create the derivative of all wrt arguments (see below _derivative creation_).
//!
//! The last part is replacing the `AutoDiff` node with either the single derivative (in case of scalar output),
//! or a vector-constructor (in case of vector-output).
//!
//! ## Derivative creation
//!
//! Derivative creation is a two step process.
//! The first pass explores the computational tree, and tags nodes that are depending on the wrt-argument, _dynamically_.
//! That lets the actual forward pass distinguish the case f'(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) from the case f'(c) = 0
//!
//!
//! Finally we are ready to do the forward accumulation. The nice
//! part being, that for any constant we can reuse parts of the original
//! graph.
