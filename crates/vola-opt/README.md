# Vola-Opt

The _optimizer_ or _middle-end_ of the vola compiler infrastructure.

There are multiple levels within opt, that get progressively lowered from an AST-like representation to an SPIR-V like representation using the 
[RVSDG](https://gitlab.com/tendsinmende/vola/-/tree/main/crates/rvsdg) crate.

## Hints

- export `VOLA_BACKTRACE=1` to enable backtraces whenever the optimizer panics.
- export `VOLA_DUMP_ALL=1` to dump intermediate states of the optimizers to svg
  -> Have a look at the code base / grep for `VOLA_DUMP_*` to dump specific pass stages
- export `VOLA_EXPORT_ALL=1` to export all Î»-Regions, which in turn makes them visible to the debugger in all stages.

## Todo ðŸ“”

- [ ] Right now we'll have a lot of dead nodes in the Î»-Regions after some transformations. That is not _really_ a problem, but implementing the generic dead-node-elimination would probably be a good idea anyways
- [ ] We currently don't catch recursive field-calls. Instead the compiler panics when trying to inline those atm.
